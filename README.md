# Gidl mode for vim

This is a [Gidl][] mode for vim which features syntax highlighting.

## Install

If you use the vundle package manager, add the line `Package 'pchickey/vim-gidl'`
to your `.vimrc`, then run `:BundleInstall`.

If you use the Pathogen package manager, clone the `vim-gidl` repo into your
`~/.vim/bundle` directory.
